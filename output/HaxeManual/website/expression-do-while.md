## 5.15 do-while

A do-while loop starts with the `do` keyword followed by the loop body expression. After that follows the `while` keyword, an opening parenthesis `(`, the condition expression and a closing parenthesis `)`:

```haxe
do expression while(condition);
```

The condition expression has to be of type `Bool`.

As the syntax suggests, the loop body expression is always evaluated at least once, unlike [while](expression-while.md) loops.
