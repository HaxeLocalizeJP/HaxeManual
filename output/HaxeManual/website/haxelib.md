## 11 Haxelib

Haxelib is the library manager that comes with any Haxe distribution. Connected to a central repository, it allows submitting and retrieving libraries and has multiple features beyond that. Available libraries can be found at <http://lib.haxe.org>.

A basic Haxe library is a collection of `.hx` files. That is, libraries are distributed by source code by default, making it easy to inspect and modify their behavior. Each library is identified by a unique name, which is utilized when telling the Haxe Compiler which libraries to use for a given compilation.
