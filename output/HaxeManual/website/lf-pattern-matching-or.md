## 6.4.6 Or patterns

The `|` operator can be used anywhere within patterns to describe multiple accepted patterns:

```haxe
    var match = switch(7) {
      case 4 | 1: "0";
      case 6 | 7: "1";
      case _: "2";
    }
    trace(match); // 1
```

If there is a captured variable in an or-pattern, it must appear in both its sub-patterns.
