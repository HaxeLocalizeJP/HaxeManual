## About this document

This document is a collection of independent articles about Haxe. The idea is to have several community members contribute and maintain documentation on interesting Haxe projects for others to read and, ideally, replicate in order to get (more) familiar with Haxe. These articles are grouped by difficulty, roughly following these guidelines:

* Beginner: People who are new to Haxe and are not yet very familiar with its concepts.
* Intermediate: People who have been using Haxe for a while but would like to extend their horizon.
* Advanced: People who have been using Haxe for quite a while and are interested in advanced concepts and gory details.

Unlike the Haxe 3 Manual, this is not a strictly technical document. This should be reflected in the general tone which may be very relaxed and casual. We also encourage authors to break up text with screenshots, diagrams or other images.
